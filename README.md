This repository hosts my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles of 2023. I'm using Python and my main objective is to
come up with easy-to-read solutions.

## Problem Instances

As we are [not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/) to publish the problem

convetion: `day_[TWO_DIGIT_DAY].txt`
